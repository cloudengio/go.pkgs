# Package [cloudeng.io/cmdutil](https://pkg.go.dev/cloudeng.io/cmdutil?tab=doc)

```go
import cloudeng.io/cmdutil
```

Package cmdutil provides support for implementing command line utilities.

## Variables
### ErrInterrupt
```go
ErrInterrupt = errors.New("interrupted")

```
ErrInterrupt is returned as the cause for HandleInterrupt cancellations.



## Functions
### Func BuildInfoJSON
```go
func BuildInfoJSON() json.RawMessage
```
BuildInfoJSON returns the build information as a JSON raw message or nil if
the build information is not available.

### Func CopyAll
```go
func CopyAll(fromDir, toDir string, ovewrite bool) error
```
CopyAll will create an exact copy, including permissions, of a local
filesystem hierarchy. The arguments must both refer to directories.
A trailing slash (/) for the fromDir copies the contents of fromDir rather
than fromDir itself. Thus:

    CopyAll("a/b", "c") is the same as CopyAll("a/b/", "c/b")
    and both create an exact copy of the tree a/b rooted at c/b.

If overwrite is set any existing files will be overwritten. Existing
directories will always have their contents updated. It is suitable for very
large directory trees since it uses filepath.Walk.

### Func CopyFile
```go
func CopyFile(from, to string, perms os.FileMode, overwrite bool) (returnErr error)
```
CopyFile will copy a local file with the option to overwrite an existing
file and to set the permissions on the new file. It uses chmod to explicitly
set permissions. It is not suitable for very large fles.

### Func Exit
```go
func Exit(format string, args ...interface{})
```
Exit formats and prints the supplied parameters to os.Stderr and then calls
os.Exit(1).

### Func HandleInterrupt
```go
func HandleInterrupt(ctx context.Context) (context.Context, context.CancelCauseFunc)
```
HandleInterrupt returns a context that is cancelled when an interrupt signal
is received. The returned CancelCauseFunc should be used to cancel the
context and will return ErrInterrupt as the cause.

### Func HandleSignals
```go
func HandleSignals(fn func(), signals ...os.Signal)
```
HandleSignals will asynchronously invoke the supplied function when the
specified signals are received.

### Func IsDir
```go
func IsDir(path string) bool
```
IsDir returns true iff path exists and is a directory.

### Func ListDir
```go
func ListDir(dir string) ([]string, error)
```
ListDir returns the lexicographically ordered directories that lie beneath
dir.

### Func ListRegular
```go
func ListRegular(dir string) ([]string, error)
```
ListRegular returns the lexicographically ordered regular files that lie
beneath dir.

### Func VCSInfo
```go
func VCSInfo() (revision string, lastCommit time.Time, dirty, ok bool)
```
VCSInfo extracts version control system information from the build info
if available. The returned values are the revision, last commit time,
a boolean indicating whether there were uncommitted changes (dirty) and a
boolean indicating whether the information was successfully extracted.
