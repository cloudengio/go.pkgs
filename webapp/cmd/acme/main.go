This command forms the basis of managing TLS certificates for
multiple host domains. The configuration relies on running a dedicated
acme client host that is responsible for interacting with an acme service
for obtaining certificates. It will refresh those certificates as they near
expiration. However, since this server is dedicated to managing
certificates it does not support any other services and consequently all
other services do not implement the acme protocol. Rather, these other
services will redirect any http-01 acme challenges back to this dedicated
acme service. This command implements two sub commands: 'cert-manager' which
is the dedicated acme manager and 'redirect-test' which illustrates how
other services should redirect back to the host running the 'cert-manager'.

Certificates obtained by the of cert-manager must be distributed to all other
services that serve the hosts for which the certificates were obtained. This
can be achieved by storing the certificates in a shared store accessible to all
services, or by simply copying the certificates. The former is preferred and
a shared store using AWS' secretsmanager can be used to do so as per
cloudeng.io/aws/awscertstore.

A typical configuration, for domain an.example, could be:

  - run cert-manager on host certs.an.example. Port 80 must be accessible to
    the internet. It could be configured with www.an.example and an.example
	as the allowed hosts/domains for which it will manage certificates.
  - all instances of services that run on www.an.example and an.example must
    implement the redirect to certs.an.example as implemented by the
	redirect test.
  - the dns entries for an.example and www.an.example need not include the
    IP address of certs.an.example.
  - cert-manager will periodically issue http GETS against
    https://www.an.example and https://an.example that are directed to itself
    (bypassing DNS) to initiate the refresh process. Note that the same
	effect can be achieved using curl's resolve option - for example:

	   curl --cacert letsencrypt-stg-root-x1.pem --resolve an.exmaple:443:<ip-address-of-cert-manager-host> https://an.example

This approach allows for automated management TLS certifcates for server
farms that live behind firewalls/loadbalancers, are hosted on services
such as AWS fargate, ECS/EKS etc with no overhead other than implementing
the http-01 redirect and having access to the certificates.
