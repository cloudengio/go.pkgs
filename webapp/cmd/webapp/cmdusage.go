// Usage of webapp
//
//	Run a webapp server. Two modes are supported: production anddevelopment.
//
//	For production, all assets are built into the production server's binary.
//
//	For development, the front-end code/assets can be managed in two ways:
//
//	1. with embedded assets that can be overridden with newer or new files found on
//	the local filesystem. This is generally used when the javascript/webapp tooling
//	only supports generating new assets rather than any form of dynamic update. The
//	user must reload the site/page to see the new version.
//
//	2. with a development server, such as that provided by webpack, that dynamically
//	monitors the javascript/webapp code and dynamically rebuilds the assets. To use
//	this mode, this application will proxy all of the urls that it doesn't itself
//	implement to the running development server. The dev server may be started by
//	this server via the --webpack-dir option. Alternatively, a running dev server
//	may be used via the --webpack-server option.
//
//	If a self-signed cerificate is required, the cert command can be used to generate
//	one.
//
//	            prod - run a production server.
//	             dev - run a development server.
//	self-signed-cert - create a self signed certificate
