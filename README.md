# go.pkg contains a set of broadly useful go modules.

It contains the following submodules, each of which can be imported and
versioned independently of one another.

- [errors](errors/README.md): provides support for working with go errors post go 1.13.
- [sync](sync/README.md): provides easy to use patterns for working with goroutines and concurrency.


# CI notes
- circecli is used for unit tests
- github actions are used for linting
